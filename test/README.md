## Generate Tests ##
Run the following commands to clone and build riscv-tests:

    git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests
    cd riscv-tests
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    autoconf
    ./configure
    make
    make install
    cd ..

Run gen\_test.py:

    ./gen_test.py

That command will generate all binary files to test the emulator.

To generate your own tests, the directory contains a makefile to turn assembly instructions into a binary file that the emulator can accept.

## Execution ##

Every binary file is divided into blocks, each one is a test that ends with a conditional jump. 
If the condition is true the next instruction is marked as fail, so something went wrong, otherwise the next block is executed.
The last test has two conditional jumps to the fail or pass instruction.
Check\_correctness.py runs the executable in the mode specified (i.e Release or Debug) and checks the presence of \<pass\>  instruction address and the absence of \<fail\> in the output generated by the emulator.
For each test the script also measures the amount of time spent to execute the instructions and, if all tests are passed, displays all measurements in a graph.
