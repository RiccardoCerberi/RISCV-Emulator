## Python files 

Gen_test.py to generate binary test from riscv tests repository, if it's not installed go to https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests.
Check_correctness.py runs the executable and checks that  \<pass\>  instruction address is present and \<fail\> is not.

The makefile contains command to get the binary from test.s file, just to test basic operations.
