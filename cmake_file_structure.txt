The project structure is
    - include
        -> it contains all the library, therefore every nested folder is 
        a library that contains both the related header and the source. For example: foo/foo.h foo/foo.cpp 
    - build
        -> it contains files releated to the generator, like make.
    - bin
        It has to be configurable by the CMakeLists
        - release
        - debug
