- Cmake kits options like which compiler to use
- Set Cmake options in  settings.json file. Everything is well described
  at this link: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/blob/main/docs/cmake-settings.md#cmake-settings
 NOTE: to change the executable from debug to release there's an option: commandPallete > CMake: 
 select variante (Release or debug). REMEMBER: the configuration works because of the CMakeLists.txt
 file


In generale the cmake steps are
- Configuration: 
    It prepares the folder where the files will be located (see below to possible changes); 
    for example by conifguring the generator, creating a makefile.
    configure cmake: json.settings file change cmake.<name> options
    run -> CMake: Configure
- Build:
    Everything inside the folder prepared in the configuration process now runs; 
    for example typing make. The executable will be stored in the folder location provided by CMakeLists.txt
    Build in the palette at the bottom of vscode
- Run or debug just by pressing the icons
